# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working
This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying styles due to incorrect setup.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file contains a React component using Tailwind CSS classes.  However, these classes are not applied, leading to unexpected styling or lack thereof.  This can happen because of several reasons, such as missing build steps or incorrect Tailwind configuration.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to correctly set up Tailwind CSS to resolve this issue, ensuring styles are correctly applied.

To run the solution, make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed. Then, run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start a development server and render the component with proper styling.  Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for more detailed setup instructions based on your framework and build tools.
