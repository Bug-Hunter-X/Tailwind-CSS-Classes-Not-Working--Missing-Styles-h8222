```javascript
// Example usage in a React component
<div className="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">My Component</h1>
  <p className="text-gray-700">This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

This code will result in unexpected behavior because `bg-gray-100` and `text-gray-700` are Tailwind CSS classes, and they only work if Tailwind is correctly configured in your project. If Tailwind is not set up properly, these classes will be ignored, leading to no styling applied.
